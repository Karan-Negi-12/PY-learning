# Python Learning Repository

This repository contains all my notes, projects, and practice problems as I learn Python. It's a personal learning space where I track my progress and store resources.

## Contents

The repository is organized as follows:

* **Notes:** This directory contains my study notes, typically in `.txt` or `.md` format. Notes cover various Python concepts, syntax, and explanations.
* **Projects:** This directory includes Python projects that I've built to apply my knowledge. Projects range from small scripts to more complex applications.
* **Practice Problems:** This directory contains Python practice problems and solutions. These problems help me reinforce my understanding of specific concepts and improve my coding skills.

## Structure
* Each main directory (`Notes`, `Projects`, `Practice Problems`) may contain subdirectories organized by topic or difficulty level.
* Files and directories are named descriptively to indicate their content.

## Usage
Feel free to explore the repository to see my learning journey and the code I've written. If you're also learning Python, you might find some of the notes and practice problems helpful.

## Contribution
As this is my personal learning repository, I'm not actively seeking external contributions. However, if you have any suggestions or find any errors, feel free to create an issue.
